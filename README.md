# Hybrid Learning Models for Regression

This project explores the use of autoencoders combined with various attention mechanisms to perform feature reduction for regression tasks. The idea is to extract low-dimensional representations from high-dimensional datasets using an autoencoder and enhance them using attention layers before feeding them into regression models.

### Key Concepts:
- **Autoencoder-based Feature Reduction**: Dimensionality reduction using unsupervised neural networks.
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Integrated standard attention, multi-head attention, contextual attention, and dynamic threshold-based attention to improve feature relevance.
- **Regression Modelling**: Applied various regression algorithms on the reduced feature set and evaluated performance using MSE and RÂ² score.
- **Performance Analysis**: Compared results with traditional feature selection methods to analyze the impact of attention-augmented autoencoders.
